   - `humidity`
   - `wind_mph`
   - `wind_kph`
3. **Air Quality:**
   - `air_quality_PM2.5`
   - `air_quality_CO`
   - `air_quality_NO2`
4. **Geographical Data:**
   - `longitude`
   - `latitude`
   - `location_name`
5. **Timestamps:**
   - `last_updated_epoch`

## Steps and Methods

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Filled in missing values using statistical methods (mean/median).  
- Detected and addressed outliers with the IQR method to ensure clean data.  
- Scaled numerical features to maintain consistency across the dataset.  
- Converted raw timestamps into readable datetime formats for time-series analysis.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Climate Analysis:** Investigated temperature patterns across regions using bar charts to visualize trends.  
- **Spatial Analysis:** Created scatter plots to highlight temperature distribution based on latitude and longitude.  
- **Environmental Impact:** Analyzed correlations between air quality metrics (e.g., PM2.5, CO) and temperature to uncover dependencies.  

### 3. Forecasting Models
Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression:** Best performance with MAE of 0.0933.  
- **SARIMA:** Captured seasonality effectively (MAE: 0.0956).  
- **Ensemble Models:** Balanced robustness with MAE of 0.1057.  
- **ARIMA:** Struggled with accuracy (MAE: 0.1140).  

### 4. Advanced Analyses
- **Feature Importance:** Used Random Forest to identify key predictors such as humidity, air quality indices, and wind speed.  
- **Geographical Patterns:** Visualized country-wise weather trends using bar charts for temperature and humidity.

## Key Findings
1. Linear Regression emerged as the most accurate and efficient model for this dataset.  
2. Strong correlations were found between temperature and air quality indicators like PM2.5 and CO.  
3. Climate and spatial analyses revealed notable geographical variations in weather conditions.

## Recommendations
1. Adopt Linear Regression for real-time weather forecasting due to its simplicity and precision.  
2. Focus on reducing pollution levels during colder months when air quality is typically worse.  
3. Explore additional data sources to enhance model accuracy, such as rainfall or solar radiation.
